# üöÄ Docomate.AI

> Effortlessly generate GitHub READMEs or interact with your codebase using AI.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

**Build a creative and interactive multimodal application powered by Groq, leveraging the capabilites to solve real-world problems with a focus on user experience and innovation.**

---

## üéØ Objective

Writing code and debugging are the most exciting aspects of building any tech product. However, not every developer excels at writing documentation. Many developers struggle with writing clear and concise README files.

Docomate AI aims to solve this by allowing developers to effortlessly generate READMEs for their public GitHub repositories. There are no complex prompts or tedious forms‚Äîjust paste your repo link, select the sections you want, and the README is generated in seconds.

Another major challenge, especially for beginners exploring open-source projects, is understanding the structure of an unfamiliar codebase. With Docomate AI, users can chat with the codebase, ask questions, and get contextual insights, making navigation much easier.

Currently, Docomate AI achieves around 55% - 65% accuracy for small to mid-scale projects and approximately 80% - 85% accuracy for micro-scale projects (repos with 4‚Äì7 files).

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:

Gitanshu Sankhla (Solo Hacker so No Team)

### Team Members:

- **Gitanshu Sankhla -** Responsible for Frontend, Backend, Database, and Generative AI aspects of the project.

### Your Approach:

#### Why you chose this problem

- As a regular GitHub user, I often push even my smallest toy projects to the platform. However, I can‚Äôt always deploy them, so when I share these repositories, people have no clue how to set them up, what the project does, or what its features are. Every project deserves a good README, but writing one can take an entire weekend.

- That‚Äôs when I thought‚Äîwhat if we could generate READMEs in just one click and under 8 seconds?

#### Key challenges you addressed

- I had no prior experience building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. While I was familiar with using AI APIs, ingesting an entire repo posed a serious challenge. Pasting the entire codebase into a prompt works only for very small projects.

  To address this, I built a scraper that clones the repo and compiles all its content‚Äîalong with file metadata‚Äîinto a single text file. I then used Langchain to chunk this file and stored the chunks and their vector embeddings in a MongoDB database.

- The next major challenge involved MongoDB‚Äôs vector search capabilities. It turned out that MongoDB‚Äôs native vector search wasn‚Äôt compatible with the data model I used. So, I implemented a custom cosine similarity algorithm, tweaked it to return previous and next chunks for better context, and integrated it into the system. This was one of the most complex features I developed.

#### Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking

- Initially, I wanted to only focus on generating README files from a GitHub repo link. However, during the hackathon, I realized that understanding someone else‚Äôs codebase is a much bigger problem for beginners. This led to a major pivot‚ÄîI decided to implement a chat interface where users could talk with the codebase to understand it better.

- While experimenting with MongoDB‚Äôs vector search capabilities, I discovered that it didn‚Äôt suit my specific data structure. This unexpected limitation forced me to brainstorm an alternative. After extensive research and testing, I ended up building a custom cosine similarity search algorithm, which actually performed better in my use case.

- I also faced a breakthrough moment while designing the scraping logic. Initially, I tried directly feeding code into the LLM, but it wasn‚Äôt scalable. The idea to build a custom repo scraper that parses file structure and contents with metadata into a vectorized knowledge base allowed me to scale the application to larger projects.

- Another breakthrough came when I decided to use BackBlaze B2 for storing generated READMEs instead of a traditional database or S3 bucket. This provided an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable way to store and serve large markdown files.

## üß¨ Future Scope

Docomate AI v1.0.0 successfully addresses two major developer pain points: generating GitHub documentation (README) and understanding complex codebases. In future iterations, I plan to introduce the following features:

- Auto-generating API documentation following the OpenAPI standard.
- A service similar to Docsify for creating client and developer documentation.
- Multilingual support for codebase interactions.
- Subscription-based access to premium AI models and features.
